Chip8 Emulator

no 48 extensions or anything.

Accepts a rom name from the commandline or it will try to run MERLIN by default.
Has a sound, in sound.wav, swap it out if you want to change it.
Colors are hard set to green FG and #080808 BG. Feel free to PR.

Everything should be working as intended to the base spec. If you find something, Issue it please.
